# My 2020 Reading Notes

These are some of the notes for the books I'm reading in 2020. The books on this list are my non-fiction reads. This compilation focuses on technology, science, history (as it relates to technology), business, and wherever else my interests take me. Not on this list are my readings in fiction, faith, humor, and wherever else my passions take me. 

## Currently Reading
* [The E Myth](https://github.com/OrionSeven/2020BookNotes/blob/master/The%20E%20Myth)
* [Obviously Awesome](ObviouslyAwesome.md)

## Plan to Read
* The Unicorn Project (Yes it's fiction, but it's about technology)
