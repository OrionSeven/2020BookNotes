# The E Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It

## Why I'm Reading This
I've always been fascinated by small businesses. In fact for much of my career I've worked for startups, which are small businesses with the hopes of being big ones. (Though I now challange that assumption I've always had). 

When I experience a small business, it's obvious some "get it" and some don't. This is reflected in how many businesses fail in the first few years. Yet, what they "get" is sometimes elusive. From customer service, to good marketing, or even a proper "Open" sign, a lot can be missed. This has always fasscinated me. Why do some people seem to get it, why do others not, and what is "it"?

So when I first heard of this book it immediatly caught my eye with this statement, "E-Myth - the fatal assumption that an individual who understands the technical work of a business can successfully run a business does that technical work."
