# Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It
by April Dunford

## Introduction

* Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about.
* Weak positioning diminishes everything you do in marketing & sales. And thus the whole business. 
* Positionoing is "context setting" for products.
  * It connects the customer with the product
  * *Customers need to be able to easily understand what your product is, why it's special and why it matters to them.*
* It should be done deliberately to maximize the success of your business.

> Strategy is about making choices, trade-offs; it's about deliberately choosing to be different. - Michael Porter

### The Signs of Weak Positioning
1. Current customers love you, but new prospects can't figure out what you're selling
2. Your company has long sales cycles and low close rates, and you're losing out to the competition
3. You have high customer churn
4. You're under price pressure
